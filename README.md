I'm excited to share my latest project on analyzing Diwali Sales using Python. This analysis explores various aspects of  product purchases based on Gender, States, city , orders placed based baes on marrital status 


## Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Converted date columns to datetime format, handled missing values, and standardized discount formats.
Cost Analysis: Calculated total costs, profits, and visualized the distribution of delivery fees, commissions, and payment processing fees.
Visualizations: Created insightful plots to analyze order value distribution, number of orders over time, and average order value by payment method.
Profit Insights: Determined the overall profit from the dataset and visualized the cost distribution to understand major expense components.

## Key Insights:
